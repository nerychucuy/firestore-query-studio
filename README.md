# Firebase Query Studio

A simple yet powerful application to query Firebase data.

## Why is this better than Firebase UI?

* It allows to easily filter collections on multiple fields

## Run this project

* Use `.env.example` to know which env variables need to be configured
* Get Firebase config file from `Project Settings > General > Web App > Firebase SDK snippet > Config`

> This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
